* SnykVulnChecker

*Note:* Npm-projects only, no Ruby-checking

SnykVulnChecker is a simple Haskell program that takes a package.json
and a RSS 2.0 feed containing vulnerabilities in the format that the
[[https://snyk.io/vuln/feed.xml][RSS-feed by Snyk]] has. Such a file can be used to check npm-projects
for vulnerabilities.

If you want to check a repository but do not host it on github or it
is private and do not want to grant excess to a third party you can
simply use this script to check against a provided database.

You could run this script as a git-hook and have a cronjob installed,
that fetches new versions of the feed regularly in order to get a
status update on every commit.
